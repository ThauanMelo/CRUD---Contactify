# CRUD - Contactify

Welcome to the CONTACTIFY GitHub repository! This is a CRUD application built using the MVC architecture in C# .NET.

The main objective of this project is to provide a simple, yet efficient way to manage data in a database. In this repository, you will find all the necessary code and resources to run the application and understand its inner workings.

Throughout the development process, I strived to use best practices and follow coding standards to make the application more maintainable and scalable. Additionally, I took security into account and implemented measures to prevent common vulnerabilities.

If you are interested in learning more about the MVC architecture, C# .NET, or how to build a CRUD application, feel free to browse the code and resources in this repository. Thank you for your interest in CONTACTIFY!
